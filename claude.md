There is one more issueFor the chat bath like it's related to something precisely dynamic resizability instead of going vertically expanding it's expanding horizontally so that's the issue and one more thing the digit bar that should not move only the chat box the chat interface that is there should move that's how it should work 

remove the edit revier butotn that is shown in the @detacheble-window.html file it shoul only appear after clocking the end meeting button that should only be the trigger that opens it, not other things can open the diff window

The all detachable windows are connected to the main application if the main application closes ,all the detachable windows should be closed (should be closed gracefully)
